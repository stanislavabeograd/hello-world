 <h1>A brief history of Firefox</h1>

    <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">mozilla</a>/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.</p>
    <p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to “switch to a different search provider across the entire browser,” and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.</p>
